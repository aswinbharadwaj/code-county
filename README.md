Quizzing App for the Programming and Debugging Event

FEATURES (personally felt these were important):

This application consists of the complete interface required to conduct a quiz (with bonus questions displayed once the normal questions are answered).
Tested to work fine with smaller monitors and using mozilla versions 14 upwards.
The application especially handles page refresh using f5 or the refresh button.
The application uses jsonp for cross server ajax calls ( figured it very late during dev :P ).
Extensive validation and user identity check (Look into *suggested improvements* section).
Unique id generation.
External open source code has been used to enhance interface (facebook like scroll bars/ jQuery).

For further details look into all the files.

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:

1. User face detection and matching.
2. Load balancing ( The code is very heavy )
